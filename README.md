# Applied Security Laboratory 2020
This is the project of the course Applied Security Laboratory offered by ETH Zurich in the autumn semester 2020.

All servers run on Ubuntu server 18.04.5 LTS except the Client, which runs on Peppermint OS 10.  All servers run an SSH server used for administration and to backup data through SFTP.

A system description and risk analysis can be found in the [report](Report/ASL_System_Description_and_Risk_Analysis.pdf).

## Setup
Before running the VM for the first time, please set up the `shared folder` as shown in the screenshot below. The path `/media/asl` must point to the root of this repo.

The networks are configured according to this network plan (ip addresses are defined in the `setup.sh`). ![network_plan](./doc/network_plan/sketch_network.png)

For development reason, all VMs have also a NAT interface with connection to the Internet. We will remove it before the hand in (except maybe for the client). All VMs have already OpenSSH installed.

## Description
All installations, settings **must** be done inside the `setup.sh` corresponding to your VM (for example if you want to copy a file inside the folder `/var/apache` write inside `setup.sh` `cp /media/asl/vm_folder/your_config.conf /var/apache`). If you make it manually, we will not have all the same versions of our environement. This script is launch at each boot of the VM (launch by the service `setup.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/setup.service`) or can be launch with the command `sudo systemctl start setup.service`. I recommand to make a snapshot of the state after the first setup (see on the [Virtualbox documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#snapshots)) to test if everything works from a fresh VM before you push on the master branch your new feature. 

## Credentials
In the following table you find the usernames and passwords for the relevant users of our system.
